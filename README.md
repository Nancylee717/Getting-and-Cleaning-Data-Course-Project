Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project assignment

It is Nancylee's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project which 
contains instructions about how to run analysis on dataset "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones".

Dataset:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files:

1.CodeBook.md is a code book used to describe steps how I clean up the data and create a tidy data.

2.run_analysis.R shows the process about data preparation and 5 steps requirement in the course project鈥檚 definition:
  step1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  step2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  step3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  step4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  step5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidym_sd.txt is the final data.
